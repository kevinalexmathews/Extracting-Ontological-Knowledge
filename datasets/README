README - Datasets
=================

We use various types of datasets in our evaluation covering multiple domains. This facilitates concrete evaluation of our approach and also ensures that our approach is neither dataset-oriented nor domain-dependent.

This directory shows all the six datasets and the sentences present in them.

	1. dataset-beauford-pizza	, 25 sentences
